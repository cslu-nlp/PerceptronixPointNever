    """
    Helper class for `AveragedPerceptron`:

    Instances of this class are essentially triplets of values which
    represent a weight of a single feature in an averaged perceptron.
    This representation permits "averaging" to be done implicitly, and
    allows us to take advantage of sparsity in the feature space.
    First, as the name suggests, the `summed_weight` variable is lazily
    evaluated (i.e., computed only when needed). This summed weight is the
    one used in actual inference: we need not average explicitly. Lazy
    evaluation requires us to store two other numbers. First, we store the
    current weight, and the last time this weight was updated. When we
    need the real value of the summed weight (for inference), we "freshen"
    the summed weight by adding to it the product of the real weight and
    the time elapsed.
